function W=findWeights(x,fitness)

% FUNCTION DESCRIPTION %
% This function is to compute the best compromise solution
%
% INPUT %
% 'x': It is a matrix of size P x m, where P is the total number of pareto
% optimal solutions and m is the total number of features per data point.
% each row of 'x' contains the trial weight vectors, which comprise the
% population of MOEA/D
% 'fitness': It is a matrix of size P x 2, Column 1 and 2 correspond to 
% objective values of function 1 (intra class distance with penalty) and 
% function 2 (inter class distance with penalty) respectively.
%
% OUTPUTS %
% 'f' is a vector of size 1 x 2, s.t. f(1) and f(2) contain the two
% objective function's values
